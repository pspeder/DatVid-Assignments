\subsection{Fysiske realiseringer}
As of today, only partially functioning (or fully functioning - but with very
limited/varying perfomance) DNA systems have been implemented and realised.

We have yet to see the advances that we're seeing in the Quantum-computing
field, for example, where IBM says that Quantum computers for personal use might
only be 10 years away\footnote{http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/120229-ibm-shows-off-quantum-computing-breakthroughs-says-qubit-computers-are-close}.
